<h1>Unique Log File Per Test</h1>

<p>If a log file exists in the same location and the specification and has the same base file name, but an extension of ".log" then a link to the log file will be placed in the footer 
of the specification.  This will work regardless of whether the tests are being run in parallel or sequentially.</p> 
 

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>This is specification, and the one we're linking to, contain a link to their log files.</p> 
<span c:execute="logBeforeRun()"></span>
<a c:run="concordion" href="LogbackLoggingDemo.html">Run Demo</a>
<span c:execute="logAfterRun()"></span>
</div>


<div class="example" style="background-color: #ffffd0; border: 3px solid #eeeeb0;">
<h4>Look for:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Hover over the i icons to see the tooltip logging</li>
	<li>Look at log file link on the bottom right of the page.</li>
	<li>Note that the console output is much reduced - this is a result of the logback configuration rather than this extension</li>
	<li>This extension is particularly useful when running tests in parallel, or have a large number of tests and your log file is unusable</li>
</ul>
