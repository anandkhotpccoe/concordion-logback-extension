# Logback Logging Extension

Check that various components are working. 

## [Example](-)
Confirm [11 * 12](- "multiply(#TEXT)") displays "[132](- "?=getCalculatorResult()").


<!-- div c:example="example2" class="example" style="background-color: #ffffd0; border: 3px solid #eeeeb0;" -->
#### Look for
* Hover over the 'i' icons to see the tooltip logging
* Log file links are on each example (no link at bottom of page as not logging outside of example)
* Note that the console output is much reduced - this is a result of the logback configuration rather than this extension
* This extension is particularly useful when running tests in parallel, or have a large number of tests and your log file is unusable
