# Logging

Good logging is vital to any application and this holds true for your test automation suites.  These test suites can often perform complex operations on the system under test and when they invariably break you need the logs to help you to understand what the test (and application) has done.

## Classic Logs

[Classic Logs](ClassicLog.md "c:run") being purely text data have been the staple for many years and are well supported. 

## HTML Logs

[HTML Logs](HtmlLog.md "c:run") are a step up from text logs and are able to provide the information in a more digestible format can document what your test is doing especially when they include screenshots and data to back up what the test has done.

## Tooltip Logs

[Tooltip Logs](ToolTipLog.md "c:run") provide a handy mechanism for providing information back to anyone reading the generated specification without having to drill down into the logs.
