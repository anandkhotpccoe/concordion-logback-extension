/**
 * A fixture class for the LoggingDemo.html specification.
 * <p>
 * This adds the Logging Tooltip Extension to Concordion to show logging detail in the Concordion output. The extension picks up any logging output written to
 * Logback.
 * <p>
 * For the purposes of demonstration, we are logging details of WebDriver (Selenium 2) events using the SeleniumEventLogger. (This logging uses slf4j, which
 * writes to Logback when run with the slf4j-jdk14 jar).
 * <p>
 * Run this class as a JUnit test to produce the Concordion results.
